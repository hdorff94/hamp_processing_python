# hamp_processing_python
## Preface
This is repository is used for the post-processing of the HALO microwave package (HAMP) data gained onboard the HALO research aircraft.
In specific, this is a python version that provides the measurements onto a unified grid (in time and vertical) and, from these flight-attitude corrected measurements creates quality controlled data.
## Execution
The processing can be either executed with the python routine run_hamp_processing.py or, alternatively with interactively showing quicklooks of raw measurements and steps of processed data, using the jupyter notebook run_hamp_processing_notebook.ipnyb
